# Podcasting 2.0

The topic that we will start with is: *"What's wrong with Science ... but, more importantly, what can we do to fix it?"*

One problem ... and what a fantastic problem for us to have!!! ... is that **it's impossible to keep up with the literature.** 

It's also impossible to for the traditional peer-review process to keep up with the submitted articles. We look at how we can use Git and the pre-print Rxivs to develop a better way to do peer-review. That's where Podcasting 2.0 comes in ... we explore how that might work in #100DaysOfPodcastering.
