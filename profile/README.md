# Podcasting 2.0

We will start with what's wrong with Science ... but, more important, what can we do to fix it?

One problem ... and a GREAT problem for us to have ... is that it's impossible to keep up with the literature. It's also impossible to for the traditional peer-review process to keep up with the submitted articles. We look at how we can use Git and the pre-print Rxivs to develop a better way to do peer-review. That's where Podcasting 2.0 comes in ... we explore how that might work in #100DaysOfPodcastering.
